What Is Prompt Engineering?
---------------------------

Prompt engineering refers to creating precise and effective prompts to get context-driven AI outputs from large language models (LLMs). It requires expertise in natural language processing and LLM capabilities.

Prompt engineers have to frame questions and statements that are clear and context-specific, eliciting the most relevant and accurate responses from the AI model.

Whether for generating detailed marketing reports, creating engaging website content, or developing the perfect programming language code, effective prompt engineering is a time-saving skill that industry professionals should add to their portfolios.

Note that a prompt engineer doesn’t need to be familiar with programming languages or have software development skills. Anyone with good language skills and analytical thinking can learn prompt engineering.

### Prompting Basics

Before we delve into advanced prompt techniques, let’s go over the basics of prompting to guide language models.

To begin with, prompting means using a natural language, such as English, to explain AI tools what you want and get a relevant response.

**Interacting With Language Models Through Prompts**

Large language models are generative AI tools that create human-like text based on the input they receive. These inputs are called prompts.

For instance, consider a [web agency](/tutorials/web-development-company) that wants to generate a tagline for a new website design tool they’ve developed. A well-engineered prompt, in this case, might look like this:

“Generate a tagline for a tool that makes website design easy and accessible for everyone.”

This prompt is clear and instructs the LLM on the specific type of content required – a catchy and concise tagline targeting potential users of a website design tool. The objective is to communicate your goals clearly to the LLM to receive an accurate and relevant output.

Let’s see the result this prompt gives when we feed it to ChatGPT-4:

**The Power of Context and Instruction**

To maximize the effectiveness of a language model, you must include two components in your prompts: context and instruction.

Adding context helps the model better understand the scenario, while instruction crafting tells it what you specifically want it to do.

For example, consider the prompt: “As a health and wellness blogger, summarize the four key benefits of a Mediterranean diet.” In this case:

*   **Context** – “As a health and wellness blogger” helps the model understand the perspective and depth from which to approach the summary.
*   **Instruction** – “Summarize the four key benefits of a Mediterranean diet.” tells the model what it needs to focus on and produce as output.

Providing clear and sufficient context and instruction is crucial for several reasons:

*   **Less ambiguity** – reduce the chance of receiving irrelevant or off-topic outputs.
*   **More control** – get predictable responses from the AI.
*   **Save time** – less back-and-forth communication is needed to achieve the desired result.

Here’s the result a context-driven prompt gives when we feed it to ChatGPT-4:

Prompt Elements
---------------

When crafting natural language prompts for AI chatbots, understanding the fundamental elements is crucial for achieving the desired output.

Prompt elements guide the AI model in your intended direction, ensuring clarity and context.

Here are some primary components to consider:

### Context Setting

Correctly setting the stage can make all the difference in getting the desired result.

**Importance of Context**

Context gives the AI a clear background or surrounding information that allows it to generate relevant and appropriate content. Without proper context, responses may end up being generic or off-target.

For example, if you ask the model about “Green technologies”, introducing the context of “used in transportation” narrows down the response to green technologies related to vehicles.

**Introducing Context**

A good prompt is not just about having context but introducing it effectively. The more detailed and specific the context, the better the AI’s understanding will be.

For example, instead of “Recommendations for eCommerce”, specify “Recommendations for improving an eCommerce website’s user experience.”

### Clear Instructions

Clear instructions drive contextual AI interactions.

**Crafting Precise Instructions**

Being explicit and direct with your instructions ensures more precision in AI outputs and leaves less room for ambiguity.

To illustrate, instead of prompting “Tell me about website developers”, specify to “Explain the roles and responsibilities of a website developer.”

**Avoiding Vague Language**

Ambiguity or contradictory language can confuse the model, leading to less accurate responses.

For example, “Discuss website design” is vague. Instead, “Discuss the trends in website design for eCommerce platforms” is more direct.

### Desired Output Format

Specifying the output format is crucial when developing prompts. It helps large language models with enhanced content creation.

**Formatting**

Dictating the structure or style of the AI’s response can refine outputs to the desired shape or form.

For example – requesting “List the top five tools for website developers” ensures a concise list format.

### Tone and Length

Establishing tone helps infuse a natural language emotion into the AI’s answers. Meanwhile, defining the length allows the AI models to determine their response’s depth.

**Setting the Tone**

You can govern an answer’s emotional resonance or professional grade by indicating the desired tone.

For instance, “Provide a professional critique on the following website design.”

**Length Dictates Depth**

Indicating whether you need a concise summary or an elaborate explanation ensures tailored AI responses.

For example, “Write a short introduction (30-40 words) about the evolution of responsive website design.”

Prompt Engineering Techniques
-----------------------------

Let’s now delve deeper into some foundational prompt engineering techniques and strategies to help you master model prompting.

### 1\. Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting involves generating a response without feeding the large language models any examples or prior context. This technique is ideal when you need quick answers to basic questions or general topics.

Here’s an example of zero-shot prompting with ChatGPT-3.5:

[![Example of zero-shot prompting](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20593'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

<img decoding="async" width="1024" height="593" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-zero-shot-prompting-1024x593.webp" alt="Example of zero-shot prompting" class="wp-image-92812" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-zero-shot-prompting.webp 1024w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-zero-shot-prompting-300x174.webp 300w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-zero-shot-prompting-150x87.webp 150w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-zero-shot-prompting-768x444.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-zero-shot-prompting.webp)

### 2\. One-Shot Prompting

One-shot prompting is about extracting a response based on one example or piece of context provided by the user.

To illustrate, we tried this strategy with ChatGPT-3.5:

[![Example of one-shot prompting](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20595'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

<img decoding="async" width="1024" height="595" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-one-shot-prompting-1024x595.webp" alt="Example of one-shot prompting" class="wp-image-92813" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-one-shot-prompting.webp 1024w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-one-shot-prompting-300x174.webp 300w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-one-shot-prompting-150x87.webp 150w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-one-shot-prompting-768x446.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-one-shot-prompting.webp)

### 3\. Information Retrieval

Information retrieval prompting is when you treat large language models as search engines. It involves asking the generative AI a highly specific question for more detailed answers.

Some LLMs are better at information retrieval prompts due to their data sources. For example, Google’s Gemini can access current internet information, while ChatGPT only knows what happened before January 2022.

Here’s an example of information retrieval prompting with Gemini:

[![Example of a prompt that used the information retrieval technique](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20736'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

<img decoding="async" width="1024" height="736" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/information-retrival-prompting-in-Gemini-1-1024x736.webp" alt="Example of a prompt that used the information retrieval technique" class="wp-image-105494" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/information-retrival-prompting-in-Gemini-1-1024x736.webp 1024w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/information-retrival-prompting-in-Gemini-1-300x216.webp 300w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/information-retrival-prompting-in-Gemini-1-150x108.webp 150w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/information-retrival-prompting-in-Gemini-1-768x552.webp 768w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/information-retrival-prompting-in-Gemini-1.webp 1171w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

### 4\. Creative Writing

Crafting creative content prompts can help you generate imaginative narratives, captivating stories, and unique textual expressions tailored to your audience’s preferences and interests.

Here’s an example of a prompt that asks the GPT-3.5 generative AI to write creatively:

[![Example of a prompt that elicits a creative output from a LLM](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20565'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

<img decoding="async" width="1024" height="565" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-creative-writing-1024x565.webp" alt="Example of a prompt that elicits a creative output from a LLM" class="wp-image-92815" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-creative-writing.webp 1024w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-creative-writing-300x166.webp 300w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-creative-writing-150x83.webp 150w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-creative-writing-768x424.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-creative-writing.webp)

### 5\. Context Expansion

The context expansion technique revolves around enriching the information given to the AI to effectively enhance its understanding.

A good way to write context expansion prompts is through the 5 “Ws and How” method, which involves expanding the query by asking Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How questions related to the subject matter.

Here’s how ChatGPT-4 used the method to expand the context of a simple statement: “Exercise is good for your health”.

[![Example of a context-driven prompt](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20578'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

<img decoding="async" width="1024" height="578" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-context-driven-prompt-1024x578.webp" alt="Example of a context-driven prompt" class="wp-image-92809" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-context-driven-prompt.webp 1024w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-context-driven-prompt-300x169.webp 300w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-context-driven-prompt-150x85.webp 150w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-context-driven-prompt-768x434.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-context-driven-prompt.webp)

### 6\. Content Summarization With Specific Focus

Effective prompt engineering is also about directing the AI’s attention to specific parts of the input, especially when you want concise summaries with a particular emphasis.

By crafting precise instructions, you can highlight which elements of the text you want the model to prioritize, ensuring the summary captures the essence of the desired focus.

Suppose you have a comprehensive guide on [website optimization techniques](/tutorials/website-optimization), but you’re only interested in mobile optimization strategies. In this case, your prompt should clearly indicate it.

For example, “Summarize this article on website optimization, but only focus on strategies related to mobile optimization: \[copy+paste article here\].”

Here’s how ChatGPT-4 did the task:

[![Example of a content summarization prompt](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20594'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

<img decoding="async" width="1024" height="594" src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-content-summerization-1024x594.webp" alt="Example of a content summarization prompt" class="wp-image-92816" srcset="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-content-summerization.webp 1024w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-content-summerization-300x174.webp 300w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-content-summerization-150x87.webp 150w,https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Prompt-engineering-content-summerization-768x445.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

Check out our article on [AI for Websites: How Artificial Intelligence Can Help Improve Your Website](/tutorials/ai-for-websites).

### 7\. Template Filling

Template filling lets you create versatile yet structured content effortlessly. You will use a template with placeholders to enable prompt customization for different situations or inputs while maintaining a consistent format.

**Customizing Templates With Variables and Placeholders**

In template filling, you can further customize the output of the generative AI tools by defining multiple variables for the placeholders. Typically, content managers or web developers use this strategy to create multiple customized AI-generated content snippets for their websites.

Suppose you’re managing an eCommerce website. In that case, you might use a standard template for product descriptions, allowing the AI to populate fields like product name, features, and price to create a new description with each answer.

This technique is incredibly beneficial when you need AI-generated content to meet particular guidelines or formats.

Another practical use case is the creation of automated but personalized emails. Dynamic template filling guarantees that the overall email structure is consistent, while specific content varies based on user information.

As an example, let’s take this prompt: “Generate a personalized welcome email using the template ‘Hello {Name}, Welcome to our {Service}. We’re glad you’re here! {Closing}'”

[![Example of the template filling technique](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20655'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### 8\. Prompt Reframing

Prompt reframing or AI prompt customization lets you subtly change your prompts’ wording while maintaining the query’s original intent.

It can encourage the language model to produce a variety of responses that answer the original intent in different ways.

**Wording Techniques to Maintain Intent**

One approach is to use synonyms or rephrase questions while keeping the main subject consistent. It will yield different nuances in the responses, which can be particularly useful when you’re looking for various ideas.

### 10\. Chain-Of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting is about using real-time AI interactions to guide the tool toward more accurate and comprehensive answers.

Instead of relying solely on a single prompt, you can provide a sequence of related examples or questions to refine the original query.

**How to Use Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

The key to effective chain-of-thought prompting is to break down a complex question or topic into smaller, more manageable parts. Then, present these parts as a sequence of prompts that build upon each other, nudging the AI towards the desired answer.

We asked ChatGPT-4 to provide us with an example of chain-of-thought-prompting, and here’s what it came up with:

[![Example of chain-of-thought-prompting](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20679'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### 11\. Iterative Prompting

Iterative prompting is another effective technique where you build upon previous responses by asking follow-up questions. With it, you can dive deeper into a topic, extract additional insights, or clarify any ambiguities from the initial output.

**How to Use Iterative Prompting**

The key to iterative prompting is being attentive to the AI’s initial answer. You can frame your follow-up prompt to elaborate on a specific part of that answer, dig into a subtopic, or seek clarification. It is especially useful when you need to gather detailed information.

LLMs that are more adept at natural language processing (NLP) can expertly handle iterative prompts and craft their responses in a human-like manner.

Here’s a quick example of iterative prompting using Claude AI, an LLM with good NLP capabilities:

[![Example of iterative prompting](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20931%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

### 15\. Automatic Prompt Engineer

Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) is an advancement in the field of artificial intelligence that leverages new LLM capabilities to help the AI automatically generate and select instructions for itself.

It transforms the task into a black-box optimization problem, using machine learning algorithms to generate and evaluate candidate solutions heuristically.

An AI agent uses a similar method to break tasks and generate follow-up prompts automatically, completing given jobs with minimal human interaction. To learn more about the tool, check our guide on [installing Auto-GPT](/tutorials/how-to-install-auto-gpt).

**APE Workflow Explained**

The APE workflow consists of five main steps:

1.  You give the chatbot a specific job to do and show some examples.
2.  The chatbot comes up with different ways to do the job, either by straightforward reasoning or by considering similar tasks it knows about.
3.  These different methods are then tested in practice.
4.  The chatbot rates how well each method worked.
5.  The AI will then choose a better method and apply it.

**Benefits and Applications in Machine Learning**

When equipped with self-prompting capabilities, generative AI tools can streamline tasks from context-driven data analysis to automated customer service, eliminating the need for constant human-generated prompts.

We asked ChatGPT-4 to explain the APE workflow with a simple example:
